# TrackTogether Project Proposal

## Idea

A mobile app that lets users track and organize their media, movies, TV shows, video games, anime, and books through personalized lists. It will support collaborative tracking, allowing users to share and create lists together, making it easy to discover new content and create lasting memories with others.

## Mobile Features

- **FireStore**
  - All data is stored and managed through firestore which allows for real-time updates, so when one user edits a shared list, the others will instantly see the change..

## Documentation/Tutorials

 - [Firebase Tutorial](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/using-firebase/) - Tutorial for setting up Firebase in Expo

## Timeline

**Week 1**
 - Setting up Firestore
 - Setting up Auth
 - Login and register screens
 - Logout functionality

**Week 2**
- Home Screen
- Create a list functionality
- Displaying all lists

**Week 3**
- Media screen
- Display content from APIs
- Add content to a list

**Week 4**
- Shared list functionality
- Notification screen
- Sending/Accepting invite functionality

**Week 5**
- Testing/Fixing
- Quality of life (Delete buttons, improve UI)

## Concepts / Problems
- The database structure might be a bit hard to implement shared lists to allow multiple people to share a single list
- The first time I will be implementing authentication with firebase
- Using API's in a mobile code environment
